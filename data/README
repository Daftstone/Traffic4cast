** bounding_boxes.geojson **

This file provides the bounding boxes for the competition data in the three
cities London, Madrid and Melbourne.


** loop_counter **

This folder contains open traffic count data for London, Madrid and Melbourne.
The locations of the loop counters have been mapped to the simplified OSM road graph (see below).

** road_graph **

© OpenStreetMap contributors - this folder contains a simplified road graph for
London, Madrid and Melbourne based on Map data from OpenStreetMap.

OpenStreetMap (OSM) data licensed under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)
by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF):
"You are free to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt our data, as long as you credit

The files road_graph_edges.parquet and road_graph_nodes.parquet contain the simplified graph
with the bare minimum attributes as node/edge graph structure. Where necessary additional
nodes were added for the mapping to the loop counter locations (see above). Otherwise the
the original OSM node IDs were retained.

The file cell_mapping.parquet provides a mapping of each edge in the road graph to the
intersecting cells in the Traffic4cast Traffic Map Movie grid for the corresponding city
(based on bounding_boxes.geojson).


** submissions **

This folder is empty and will be used by participants for preparing their submissions.


** train **

This folder provides the training input data for all three cities.

The subfolder <city>/input contains the loop_counter (see above) information pre-processed
in order to be directly consumable by a data loader.

The subfolder <city>/labels is being generated after downloading the Traffic4cast 2022 datasets
from https://developer.here.com/sample-data and running the label pre-processing script,
for more information see https://github.com/iarai/NeurIPS2022-traffic4cast
